### ReversingLabs A1000 Malware Analysis Appliance

Reversing Labs TitaniumCloud Community App

Publisher: ReversingLabs

Product Vendor: ReversingLabs


This app supports using ReversingLabs Advanced File Analysis to 'detonate file' on the A1000 Advanced Malware Analysis Appliance.

The A1000 appliance is a powerful threat detection and file analysis platform that integrates other ReversingLabs technologies (TitaniumCore - the automated static analysis solution, and TitaniumCloud File Reputation Service) to provide detailed information on each file's status and threat capabilities.

The A1000 makes it easy to upload multiple samples for analysis. It can process, unpack, and classify them in a matter of milliseconds, and display detailed analysis reports. Historical analysis results are preserved in a database to enable in-depth searching, and malware samples are continually reanalyzed to ensure the most up-to-date file reputation status.

The A1000 relies on several threat classification methods, including YARA rules and ReversingLabs hashing algorithm (RHA) that classifies files based on their functional similarity.
